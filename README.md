# AI-Stock-Trader

## General Information

This is my hobby training program where I aim to learn about various aspects of stock trading and data analysis. It may seem ambitious, but it's a fun and educational project.

## Plan

### Stock Data Collection

- The goal is to create modules for all known stock platforms to reliably gather data.
- The first system to be implemented is Yahoo Finance, with plans to add more platforms later.

Currently deployed with Python and MySQL.

### Additional Stock Data Collection

- Scrape news and other correlated media that affect stock prices.
- The approach for this is still under consideration.
- Categorize and analyze all collected media.

Currently deployed with Python and MongoDB.

### Processing Collected Data

The plan is to analyze all data to find correlations between stock movements and events in the news and the world. This is still in the planning phase, considering whether to use deep learning or clean the data first.

### Training Environment

Once the data is available, the AI model will be trained with historical data. The initial focus will be on 5 stocks with the oldest available information. The AI will have 1 million euros as play money.

- The first training will be conducted on a yearly basis. The AI will analyze the first year's data and make predictions for the next year, providing suggestions on what actions to take.
- The AI's performance will be scored based on the profit it can generate. Once we are satisfied with the yearly training results, we will proceed to monthly training, and so on.
