# Frontend Pre-commit Test

This file is created to test the pre-commit hooks functionality for the frontend.

## Test Results

- ✅ ESLint configuration working
- ✅ Prettier formatting working
- ✅ TypeScript type checking working
- ✅ Lint-staged targeting correct files
- ✅ Husky git hooks integration working

The pre-commit hooks will automatically:

1. Run ESLint on staged TypeScript/JavaScript files
2. Format code with Prettier
3. Check TypeScript types
4. Only process staged files for efficiency

## Notes

- Configuration files (_.config.js, _.setup.js) are ignored by ESLint
- Only warnings remain, no blocking errors
- Pre-commit hooks successfully prevent commits with issues
