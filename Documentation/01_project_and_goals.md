## System Architecture

### Core Components

1. **Management System (High-Security Module)**
   - Isolated, high-security control center
   - Core Components:
     - Nginx reverse proxy for secure access
     - Protected frontend interface
     - Secured backend with dedicated REST API
     - Isolated management database

   - Security Architecture:
     - Zero-trust security model
     - Dynamic permission system
     - Per-agent encryption keys
     - Daily key rotation
     - Minimal static permissions
     - Just-in-time access control
     - Automated threat response
     - Independent key infrastructure
     - Anomaly detection and response

   - Access Control:
     - Default minimal agent permissions
     - Dynamic task-based authorization
     - Automatic permission expiration
     - Real-time permission monitoring
     - Immediate revocation capabilities
     - Isolated agent credentials
     - Independent security domains

2. **Data Architecture**
   - Segregated databases:
     - Management database (isolated)
     - Processing databases (separate)
   - Data flow through load balancer
   - REST API processing layer

3. **Node Agent**
   - Installed on processing nodes (e.g., Ubuntu VMs)
   - Acts as intermediary between Management System and Processing Modules
   - Controls module deployment and execution
   - Monitors node health and performance

4. **Processing Modules**

   Current implemented modules:

   - Stock Market Data Collector
   - News and Information Collector
   - Load Balancer for REST APIs
   - REST API Processing Units

   Planned future modules:

   - AI Analysis Module
   - Trading Strategy Module
   - Risk Management Module

### System Flow

1. Management System provides secured control interface
2. Node Agents authenticate and receive encrypted instructions
3. Agents manage module deployment and database access credentials
4. Processing modules work with data through load balancer and REST APIs only
5. All sensitive operations logged and monitored

### Scalability

The modular architecture allows for:

- Easy addition of new processing nodes
- Dynamic deployment of new modules
- Horizontal scaling of processing capacity
- Independent module updates and maintenance

This document will be updated as the project progresses and new requirements are identified.
