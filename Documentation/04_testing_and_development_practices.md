# Testing and Development Practices

## Development Environment Setup

### Local Development

1. Container-Based Environment

   - Docker Compose configuration
   - Local database instances
   - Mock agent services
   - Development certificates
   - Local key management

2. Security Requirements
   - Local SSL certificates
   - Development key rotation
   - Isolated test databases
   - Mock security services
   - Local permissions system

### Development Setup Requirements

1. Basic Requirements

   - Git repository clone
   - Docker installation
   - Docker Compose

2. Environment Configuration

   - All components containerized
   - Local development through Docker
   - No additional dependencies needed

3. Test Data Strategy
   - Initial test data: Public APIs
   - Mock data: Planned after initial system completion
   - Test data generation: To be implemented

### Disaster Recovery

1. Current Strategy

   - Agents maintain operation during management system outage
   - Task completion state preservation
   - Automatic reconnection and state sync
   - Self-healing capabilities planned
   - Comprehensive DR plan pending system maturity

2. Management System Backup
   - PostgreSQL dumps before updates
   - Further backup strategies in planning
   - Recovery procedures to be developed

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Testing

   - Access control chains
   - Security event handling
   - Threat response systems

### End-to-End Testing

1. Complete Workflows

### Version Control

1. Branch Strategy

   - main: Stable production code
   - test: Pre-production testing and validation
   - dev: Current development work
   - Simple workflow suitable for single developer
   - Version numbering postponed until core functionality complete:
     - Management System operational
     - Agent system working
     - Basic deployment validated

2. GitHub Integration

   - Issue tracking for feature requests and bugs
   - Project boards for development planning
   - Pull requests for code review
   - Actions for automated testing and deployment
   - Security alerts and dependency scanning
   - Automated vulnerability patches
   - Package management

3. Code Review
   - Self-review checklist
   - Security review points
   - Architecture compliance
   - Documentation requirements
   - Test coverage verification

## CI/CD Pipeline

### Automated Testing

1. Test Suites
