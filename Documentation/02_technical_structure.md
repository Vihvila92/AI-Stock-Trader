# Technical Structure Documentation

## Management System Architecture

### Frontend Layer

- Framework: Next.js with TypeScript
- Key Features:
  - Server-side rendering for improved performance
  - API routes integration
  - Real-time system monitoring dashboard
  - Module deployment interface
  - Agent management console
  - System health monitoring
  - Authentication and user management
  - Static page generation where applicable

### Backend Layer

- Technology: Python FastAPI
- Components:
  - REST API service
  - Authentication service
  - WebSocket server for real-time updates
  - System monitoring service
  - Agent communication handler

### Database Layer

- PostgreSQL for management data
- Key Schemas:
  - User management
  - System configuration
  - Agent registry
  - Deployment logs
  - Security audit logs

### Security Infrastructure

- Nginx reverse proxy configuration
- SSL/TTLS encryption
- JWT authentication
- IP whitelisting
- Rate limiting
- Request validation

## Node Agent Architecture

### Security Model

- Encrypted Communication:
  - Individual agent-specific encryption keys
  - Daily key rotation
  - Separate keys for each communication channel
  - Zero trust architecture

- Access Control:
  - Static permissions limited to:
    - Status updates
    - Role verification
    - Task queue checking
  - Dynamic, time-limited permissions
  - Immediate permission revocation
  - Anomaly-based access termination

- Key Management:
  - Initial registration key for first contact
  - Unique per-agent runtime keys
  - Automatic daily key rotation
  - Compromised key isolation
  - Independent key infrastructures

### Core Components

- Python-based agent service
- Docker integration
- System monitoring tools
- Module deployment handler
- Security features:
  - Encrypted communication
  - Certificate-based authentication
  - Secure credential management

### Agent Capabilities

- Module lifecycle management
- Resource monitoring
- Log aggregation
- Health checks
- Automatic recovery
- Security enforcement

## Processing Modules

### Stock Market Data Collector

- Real-time market data processing
- Historical data management
- Data validation and cleaning
- Error handling and retry logic

### News and Information Collector

- Multiple source aggregation
- Text processing pipeline
- Sentiment analysis
- Metadata extraction
- Data categorization

### Load Balancer

- Technology: HAProxy
- Features:
  - Request distribution
  - Health checking
  - SSL termination
  - Rate limiting
  - Access control

### REST API Processing Units

- Scalable API handlers
- Request queue management
- Data processing pipeline
- Response caching
- Error handling

## Database Architecture

### Management Database

- PostgreSQL-based central management database
- Manages all system databases and their structures
- Handles database creation and maintenance
- Monitors database health and performance
- Current backup: SQL dump before updates
- Located on dedicated high-performance infrastructure
- Separate from agent/module infrastructure

### Processing Data Stores

- Multiple database types supported through integration
- Database structures stored in management database
- Dedicated high-performance infrastructure
- Direct database management through management system
- Independent from agent/module system
- Backup strategy under development

### Data Flow

1. Management system controls all database operations
2. Database structures and metadata centrally managed
3. Processing modules access through REST API layer
4. Load balanced database connections

## Inter-Module Communication

### Communication Model

- No direct module-to-module communication
- Agent-driven task execution:
  - Receives specific role and task
  - Executes single responsibility
  - Returns to idle state after completion
- Direct two-way communication through:
  - Load balancer
  - Processing REST API
  - Database connections

### Task Distribution

- Management system splits large tasks
- Resource-aware distribution
- Agent-specific work packages
- Independent task execution
- Result verification and aggregation

## Deployment Infrastructure

### Container Architecture

- Docker-based deployment
- Container orchestration
- Image management
- Resource allocation
- Scaling policies

### Monitoring and Logging

- Centralized logging system
- Performance metrics collection
- Alert management
- Audit trail
- System health monitoring

## Development Tools

### Version Control

- Simple branch strategy:
  - main: Production releases
  - test: Testing and validation
  - dev: Active development
- Version numbering deferred until:
  - Management System core functionality complete
  - Agent system operational
  - Basic deployment validated
- GitHub Features in use:
  - Issue tracking
  - Pull requests
  - Actions for CI/CD
  - Projects for task management
  - Security scanning
  - Dependency tracking
