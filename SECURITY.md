# Security Policy

## Current Security Architecture

The AI Stock Trader implements a zero-trust security model with multiple layers of protection:

### Core Security Features

1. Agent-Management System Communication
   - Individual per-agent encryption keys
   - Daily key rotation policy
   - Minimal static permissions
   - Dynamic, task-based access control
   - Immediate permission revocation
   - Anomaly detection and response

2. Access Control System
   - Just-in-time access granting
   - Task-specific permissions
   - Automatic permission expiration
   - Real-time monitoring
   - Independent security domains

3. Database Security
   - Isolated management database
   - Segregated processing databases
   - Access through load-balanced REST APIs only
   - Restricted connection patterns

## Security Status

The project is in active development, with the following components under construction:

- Core Management System security
- Agent authentication system
